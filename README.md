# Experimental Terraform provider for oVirt

This is an ⚠️ experiemental ⚠️ Terraform provider. It will soon be merged into the [original Terraform provider](https://github.com/ovirt/terraform-provider-ovirt) and is written on the basis of [go-ovirt-client](https://github.com/ovirt/go-ovirt-client).

This brings several advantages:

- Terraform plugin SDK v2 support
- Full test coverage
- Full documentation

Currently, the provider is only available in source form. Once it is closer to completion it will be published in the Terraform registry.
