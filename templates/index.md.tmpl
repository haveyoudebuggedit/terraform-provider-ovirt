# oVirt-ng provider

The oVirt-ng provider interacts with the oVirt Engine / RHV Manager API. The provider can be initialized in two modes:

1. By setting the `url`, `username`, `password`, and at least one of the `tls_` options for the oVirt Engine. This will
   perform all changes on the configured oVirt Engine. (You may provide more than one `tls_` option.)
2. By setting `mock = true`. In this mode the provider will perform everything in-memory. In this mode the provider
   will drop all changes from memory once it is finished. This is mainly intended for testing and should not be used
   in production.
